-PROBABLY NO some kind of raytracing algorithm to render terrain ? then we won't need dual contouring ! (see Raymarching http://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/)

-uniform manifold dual contouring (another name for dual marching cubes ?) + think about implementing adaptive variant
